    <p class="para">Epress.js or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and
        open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.[3] It has
        been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server,[5] meaning that it is relatively
        minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the back-end component of popular development stacks
        like the MEAN, MERN or MEVN stack, together with the MongoDB database software and a JavaScript front-end
        framework or library.[6]</p>

        <p class="para">React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
           Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.Component-Based Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
           Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.Learn Once, Write Anywhere

        <h4 class="h"><strong>Node jss</strong></h4>
        <p class="para">Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, 
            rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.</p>
